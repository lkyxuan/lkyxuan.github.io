I take this as the foundation of my investment philosophy, everything is neutral.
Just as entropy will not disappear, the entropy of a single system will decrease, and the reason for this is the increase of environmental entropy. 
Struggle is always present, you need to bring order to yourself, which means another part becomes more disorderly. People always talk about the damage brought by Dump, but no one thinks about the possibility that Pump created the project. 
The past me always emphasized stable development, in fact, a stable ecosystem makes everyone lose patience, they decide not to contribute to this industry. 
People always like lotteries, like excitement. Just as people can only live once, most people are not born to be a work machine, so risks and rewards are given to those who are really alive.
